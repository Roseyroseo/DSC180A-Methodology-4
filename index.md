## 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

One of the most central (and compelling) topics in our domain has been evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for biases when inevitably used in the way they are marketed. While some might argue it is the "wrong" way to use them, given that they are marketed in a way that presents them as miracle solutions, it wouldn't be strange for users to employ them in such a way. Thus, the work that we are doing is important in order to showcase that despite the miracle solution marketing, there needs to be more care in the way the technology is deployed in order to prevent or at least mitigate harm to people.

One of the most memorable papers, authored by our domain mentor 'Making Algorithms Public,' argues that we've been thinking about audits all wrong. The dominant approach treats them as a technical process to settle 'matters-of-fact', almost like a pass/fail test for bias; but this often fails because it ignores the political and social context. He proposes reframing audits around 'matters of concern', which then shifts the goal from getting a definitive answer to fostering ongoing debate and democratic accountability. In the end, it is not just about whether an algorithm or LLM model is biased, but about questioning the institutions and power structures that deploy them.

Ultimately, this resonated deeply because it moves the conversation from purely technical domain expertise, and into the broader and crucial realm of public engagement and governance.


## 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

### Potential Title: Investigating Sociotechnical Systems of AI in Education as a Matter of Concern

For our Q2 project, We are thinking of proposing an investigation into the use of AI in educational and admissions contexts. The goal is to perform a technical audit for bias several models based on a client's concerns based on interviews which will use LLMs in their particular contexts in order to validate and showcase their concerns. The goal is to conduct a sociotechnical audit that treats the entire ecosystem of AI in the classroom, and within the educational institution, as a "matter-of-concern" as opposed to a simple "matter-of-fact" approach. 

At the core of the project is the question: How does the deployment of AI in education (from K-12 learning tools to college admissions) open up or close down democratic debate about educational equity, and what are the potential consequences for widening existing social and economic gaps if these tools are not deployed responsibly?

## 3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

Ideally, the audit for our Q2 project would not be limited to the LLM outputs. As our mentor posed in his paper, the "system" includes the institutions, data, and human labor that make it work. Our investigation would ideally examine the following:

- The Institutional Context: The marketing claims of EdTech companies, the procurement policies of school districts/universities, and the pressure to find "efficient" solutions.

- The Data Pipeline: The historical data used for training, the labor of data labelers, and the categories that might be formalized (e.g. "potential").

- The Human-in-the-Loop: How teachers and admissions officers interpret and use the AI's outputs, and where their discretion might be overridden or amplified based on their testimonies.

## 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

Since we are already systematically testing the AI systems with carefully constructed inputs to probe for specific intersectional biases, (e.g. submitting identical student essays where only the names are changed) we might want to take it further by experimenting with prompting in order to analyze how AIs might penalize non-standard dialects or cultural references, which might disproportionately affect students from minoritized backgrounds. Moreover, it would be interesting to see if there is an existing link to these cultural markers, and thus a potential adverse effect to appropriating certain manners of speech.

Another potential addition would include investigating the political and economic interests that fuel the rapid implementation of some of these tools. This would reframe the perception that these aren't just everyday working tools, but also instruments of political and economic control, thus making it all the more important to scrutinize them openly and democratically.
